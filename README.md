=====

Do you want quickly migrate from Eclipse to Gradle + Android Studio?
Do you want to compile samples from Android SDK?

Use this script build.gradle with your existing file structure.

Also you do not need gradle wrapper! If you have already installed gradle 1.6 on your OS, just use:
```bash
gradle tasks
# or
gradle installDebug
```
